## 📖 About the Game

**Potion Grimoire** is a cozy idle/casual game for iOS and Android where you step into the shoes of a village alchemist. Your days are filled with cultivating magical ingredients in your garden, brewing fantastical potions to fulfill quests, and managing a quirky tavern for a guild of **cat bounty hunters** who bring you rare finds from their adventures!

The game is designed for relaxing, short play sessions. Thanks to a persistent server, your plants will grow and potions will brew even when you're offline, so you can always come back to new progress.
